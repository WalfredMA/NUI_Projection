# Saturation-Projection-for-NUI-insertion-discovery

This is the a method used to projection of NUI discoveries respect sample sizes.

Requirements:
Python 2.7
scipy 1.20 or higher


There are two components: 1. the downsampling 
                          2. up-projection based on downsampling
                          

Downsampling:

A downsampling method based on Combinatorics Math. 
Reasoning can be found: 

This is included as python2.7 package included in downsample folder.


Up-projection:

A upsampling projection method based on Math Analysis and non-linear model fitting.
Reasoning can be found:
